This is a fun Youtube music player project of mine . You can visit it [https://benevolent-zuccutto-5a7325.netlify.app/](Here). You add URLs of music videos here and play them like an MP3 music player.
## Getting Started

If you want to run this on your local machine then clone this repo and then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
